# decisions/client.md — BUILD-CLIENT (client/, sandbox/)

Earlier entries, frozen in `DECISIONS.md`: CLIENT-1 (Rust at all; ruled by ROOT 2026-10-16: custody +
transport only, ≤ 2,000 lines), CLIENT-2 (follow drives by steps; ruled, protocol in HOST-9), CLIENT-3
(attempts), CLIENT-4 (workspace dir, OpenSSH forwarding), CLIENT-5 (Ed25519 until KERNEL names the
scheme), CLIENT-6 (no binary until the generated table), CLIENT-7 (sandbox/ own crate, Hermes is a member;
ruled), CLIENT-8 (isolation invariant), KEY-CUSTODY (open, for Ember).

## CLIENT-9 one confinement shape, deny by default, one mechanism per platform, no fallback (2026-10-16; allow-list landed by CLIENT-2)
**Decision.** `sandbox/` exposes one function: `command(policy, program, args) -> Command`. The policy
is ALLOWS plus an invariant: `read`, `write`, `exec` (paths the child may touch; the program, which must
be absolute, is always read+exec) and `hidden` (paths that must lie outside every allowed path and the
platform floor; a policy where one reaches the other, either way, is refused as `Exposed` before
launch). macOS: `sandbox-exec` with `(deny default)`, `process-exec` of the program and `exec`,
`file-read*` of the floor + read/exec/write, `file-write*` of write, `file-read-metadata` of each
allowed path's ancestors (realpath stats them). The macOS floor was MEASURED by bisecting a deny-default
profile until `/bin/cat` and a lake-built Lean exe (host-sim, ALL PASS) ran: the `/` listing (literal;
dyld aborts with rc 134 without it — the predecessor's failed attempt), `/dev/urandom` (the Lean
runtime opens it at start), `/usr/lib`, `/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes` (the dyld shared cache).
No network, no mach/IPC, no fork, no sysctl. Linux: `bwrap --unshare-all --disable-userns --cap-drop
ALL --clearenv --dev /dev --proc /proc`, read-only binds of the floor (`/usr`, `/lib`, `/lib64`,
`/etc/ld.so.cache`, the optional ones `-try`) and of read/exec/program, `--bind` of write, nothing else
mounted. The environment is cleared on both. Any other platform, a missing mechanism, a missing or
unnameable path: refused by name, never launched. `nd-supervise` takes `--hide/--read/--write/--exec`.
A Host child gets `--write STORE --hide WORKSPACE` and nothing else (HOST-2's answer: STORE is the only
path it reads or writes). It gets NO socket: the child speaks only stdio, the supervisor holds the
sockets, so the brief's "allow the sockets" is deliberately not granted.
**Alternatives.** (a) The deny-list this replaced (`(allow default)` minus the hidden paths, `--ro-bind
/ /` + tmpfs); (b) Landlock on Linux (in-process, no bwrap); (c) minidregg's two bwrap profiles (P3);
(d) a whole-volume read allow with only writes restricted.
**Why.** The child is a parser of bytes from the network (a friend's frames); it should see the Store
and its own runtime, not the member's home (other keys, the ssh agent socket, browser profiles), which a
deny-list exposed. With deny-by-default the CLIENT-8 invariant is a CHECK on the policy plus a plant on
the profile, not a rule that might be forgotten. One argv shape for every child is law 1.
**Critique.** The floor is a hand list measured on ONE macOS version; an update that moves the dyld cache
breaks every child at launch (loudly: abort, which is the right failure, but a dead node). `/usr/lib`
and `/System/…/Cryptexes` are subtrees, wider than the dylibs one exe links. Children must be given
REAL paths (a `/var/…` argument fails: the `/var` link is not readable); nd-supervise does not rewrite
argv, so the service file must. `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple. The Linux branch has only been
`cargo clippy --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`-checked, never run (no Linux box; hbox is Ember's):
merged-/usr distributions with `/lib → usr/lib` symlinks may need `--symlink` instead of a bind, and
that is unknown. The tests' python children need their framework prefix as read+exec (it re-execs
itself), which is a test fixture's need leaking into the policy surface (`exec`).
**Meta-critique.** I measured the floor with the two binaries I had and stopped when they ran; a real
`host serve` (FFI to Host/c, fsync, flock on LOCK) may need more, and I am assuming flock/fsync on an
allowed fd need no extra operation. The "no sockets" call contradicts my brief; I think the brief
assumed the child dials, and HOST-2 says it does not.
**Plants.** sandbox/tests/confine.rs: confined cat reads an allowed file (control), fails on the seed in
the hidden workspace AND on an unmentioned sibling file (the allow-list property: red under the old
deny-list), a policy reaching the workspace (read its parent, or write it) is `Exposed`. Mutations:
adding `(subpath "/")` to the read clause, or `(allow default)`, turns both confine and
client/tests/supervise.rs red (`isolation: child read the seed`).
**Status.** landed (macOS run; Linux check-only).

## CLIENT-10 the step layout read by hand until it is emitted — a twin with an expiry (2026-10-16)
**Decision.** `client/src/wire.rs` reads and writes the step layouts of proposals/client.md §2
(argv, the four steps, resume) by hand, so `nd` runs end to end now. It is deleted the day PROTOCOL /
CODEC commit the layout in Lean and `Emit/Rust.lean` emits its reader; the step TAGS already come
from `generated.rs`. Asked of PROTOCOL/CODEC: the layout as a `Codec` in Lean and its Rust reader.
**Alternatives.** Wait (no `nd`, no end-to-end plant); have follow speak a layout the generator
already covers (it covers none yet).
**Critique.** This is exactly the shape law 1 forbids and HOST-5 already named: a Rust codec of a
Lean-owned shape, with a promised expiry. If the Lean layout differs, the round-trip test still passes
against its own scripted follow (a mirror) — the integration with BUILD-HOST's follow is the real check.
**Meta-critique.** ROOT asked for running binaries before my handoff, and that deadline chose this.
**Status.** superseded (CLIENT-2, 2026-10-16). CODEC landed the layouts as Lean data with an emitted
reader at f81e093 (`generated::layout::{Command, Resume, Step}`, CODEC-8: `k` and `result` are
length-prefixed); wire.rs is deleted and `run.rs` uses the generated `Step` itself (its own `Step` enum
was a second copy of the same shape). The client still checks the encoded `command` against
`ARGV_BYTES_MAX`, because the emitted `list` bounds each item and the count, not the total
(`Bounds.argvBytesMax` is stated as the total; asked of CODEC to make the Lean codec carry it).

## CLIENT-11 the member signature: pure Ed25519 or hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65, and Lean verifies it (2026-10-16, NOT IMPLEMENTED: waits for KERNEL)
**What is already fixed.** KERNEL's `Receive.Call` carries one opaque `signature : ByteArray` under one
`key : ByteArray`, and `Ctx.verify : key → message → signature → Bool` is the ONLY check
(`Derive.lean`: `badSignature`, `badPossession`). So the scheme is a property of the deployed `Ctx`, not
of the call shape. Custody's side is one function, `sign(message) -> bytes`, over the exact bytes a
`sign` step names; Rust never verifies, never decides acceptance, never chooses what is signed.
**Decision (proposed, for KERNEL).** Hybrid, as one opaque pair inside the existing fields:
`key = ed25519_pk (32) ‖ mldsa65_pk (1952)`, `signature = σ_ed (64) ‖ σ_ml (3309)`, both over the SAME
message under one domain (`Env.hash` customization, CODEC-7), and `verify` = BOTH halves verify, each
length exact, refused by name per half (`badSignature` split into `badEd25519` / `badMlDsa` so a row
can tell which leg failed). Custody derives both keys from the one 32-byte seed by a named KDF
(cSHAKE256 domain per scheme; ML-DSA keygen takes a 32-byte ξ), so there is still exactly one secret.
The precommitted next-key digest (KERNEL-6) commits to the whole pair.
**Who verifies.** Lean, in `Ctx.verify`, at the Host's `receive` and at every follower's `rederive`
(PROTOCOL-4). HOST-2 reports (10-16) that no layer owns an Ed25519 `verify` in Lean today, so a real
`host serve` cannot run yet even for pure Ed25519; this blocks CLIENT's real round trip (B) as well.
Options for the verifier, in order of preference: (i) an FFI to a verified C implementation (HACL*
Ed25519 and the libcrux/HACL* ML-DSA, the EverCrypt line) declared in Lean with the call's premise
asserted where it enters (law 4), census-listed; (ii) Ed25519 restated in Lean over GMP-backed `Nat`
(feasible, slow: a scalar mult per verify; ML-DSA in pure Lean is a larger port). Rust verification
(ed25519-dalek beside the Lean path) is refused: it is a Rust decision and a twin.
**Alternatives.** (a) Pure Ed25519 (today's custody, CLIENT-5). (b) Hybrid as two fields in the Call
(`sigEd`, `sigMl`), visible to KERNEL. (c) ML-DSA only.
**Why hybrid.** The log is permanent and followers re-verify it forever; a signature scheme broken later
(a quantum adversary against Ed25519) lets anyone forge history a NEW follower would fold. Ed25519 is kept
because ML-DSA is young (implementation bugs, side channels); the AND means a forger must break both.
**Critique of hybrid.** 3,373 bytes per signature and 1,984 per key against 64/32: at THE BAR (1000
records) that is ~3.4 MB of signatures, per `log` page ~70 signatures fit in one 256 KiB frame, and
every follower fold verifies both halves (HOST-11 already names verify as the cold follow's dominant
cost; ML-DSA-65 verify is, from published benchmarks I have not re-measured, of the order of Ed25519's, so
the cost is mostly bytes and I/O, not CPU). The PQ threat to a two-friends deployment is hypothetical today; the cost is
paid now. And the AND is only as good as its weakest IMPLEMENTATION: an FFI verifier that returns true
on a malformed σ_ml (or a Lean glue that ignores one half) gives Ed25519-only security while every
document says hybrid. That is exactly minidregg's state: its SDK signed under
`MINI/SDK/HYBRID/ML-DSA-65/v1`, the verifier's comment said Lean's `CredentialSignatureIO.combineHalves`
decided the conjunction, that function did not exist, and `verify-mldsa` had no caller: the ML-DSA half
was verified NOWHERE on the Lean path (DELETE-RUST-20261016 S2; cv 01a14700). So hybrid ships only with
two plants: a call whose σ_ed is valid and σ_ml is flipped must be refused `badMlDsa`, and vice versa,
both as rows against the real `host serve`, both mutation-checked.
**Critique of pure Ed25519.** One scheme, 64 bytes, a verifier small enough to restate in Lean and prove
against RFC 8032 vectors; but rotating to PQ later is a re-genesis (free here) AND a re-signing of every
member key, and the history signed before the rotation stays Ed25519-only forever, which is the attack
the hybrid exists for.
**Meta-critique.** I lean hybrid because minidregg did it and because "post-quantum" is the fashionable
answer; the honest decider is whether anyone ever follows a log signed today after a CRQC exists. The
option ordering (FFI to HACL* first) is chosen to avoid porting ML-DSA to Lean, the hard part; that
puts unverified-by-us C (but machine-verified upstream) in the TCB.
**Status.** open: KERNEL decides which signature a Turn carries (pure or hybrid, and the refusal names);
ROOT assigns who owns the Lean verifier. CLIENT implements custody's half the day it is named.

## CLIENT-12 friends over ssh: the remote host.sock (2026-10-16, DESIGN ONLY: waits for PROTOCOL's row)
**The need (THE BAR).** Two friends and a hosted Hermes on one Store. Each friend runs `nd` and their
OWN `host follow` (consent is their own fold, HOST-7) on their own machine; the one writer `host serve`
runs on the operator's box. A friend's nd must reach the remote host.sock, and the friend's follow must
get the log (`log` op, gated in Lean by a follow grant, HOST-11).
**Option A: OpenSSH StreamLocal forwarding (CLIENT-4 as written).** `ssh -N -o StreamLocalBindUnlink=yes
-L ws/host.sock:/srv/nd/host.sock friend@box`. Zero code. Each friend is a unix account on the box; the
socket must be connectable by them (0660 + a group: nd-supervise binds 0600 today, so this flips a mode).
**Option B: a forced-command bridge over one ssh channel.** The friend's machine runs `nd-supervise
ws/host.sock --hide ws --read ~/.ssh … -- /usr/bin/ssh -T box` (the SAME mux: many local connections,
conn-tagged frames over one child's stdio); on the box, the operator's `authorized_keys` has one line per
friend key: `restrict,command="nd-attach /srv/nd/host.sock"`, and `nd-attach` is the mux's inverse
(conn-tagged frames on stdin ⇄ one host.sock connection per conn; bounded by CONNECTIONS_MAX; exits on
EOF). No per-friend unix account, no group mode, no forwarding enabled in sshd (`restrict` turns it off),
revocation is deleting one line.
**Option C: a TCP listener** on the box with its own authentication (Noise/TLS + member keys). Refused:
new Rust crypto, a public port, and a second authenticated channel beside ssh; the Host already
authenticates every request by signature in Lean, so transport auth is only DoS control.
**Recommendation: B.** Because: sshd cannot restrict which socket a key may forward to (no `permitopen`
for streamlocal), so A makes every friend able to reach EVERY socket their uid can connect to on the box,
and gives each friend a shell account to harden (`Match User`, `ForceCommand`, `PermitTTY no`); B gives
them exactly one bridged socket and no account. B reuses the frame wire byte for byte (law 1: the
conn-tagged child frame is already the supervisor's one shape), and the remote end is the same
supervisor protocol read the other way.
**Critique of B.** It is new code on the box's attack surface (~100 lines, `nd-attach`, parsing frame
HEADERS from an authenticated but untrusted friend) where A is zero code; a bug there is reachable by any
friend key. One ssh connection carries every conn, so one slow friend conn head-of-line blocks that
friend's others (not other friends'). The friend's ssh client runs under nd-supervise's sandbox and
needs `~/.ssh` and the network, so the sandbox policy grows a `network` allowance it has refused so far
(or the ssh child runs unconfined: it holds no member seed, but it is a second process shape).
**Critique of A.** Correct by delegation and free, but its authorization is the filesystem (group mode on
a socket) and the friend count is unix accounts; that is the "ssh access IS the grant" shape HOST-11 (c)
rejected, moved one layer down. For the operator's own Hermes (same box) A is trivially right: a local
socket, no ssh.
**What PROTOCOL must define first (the row).** Which side pulls the log for a remote friend's follow
(follow asks nd for `host(log, from)` steps through host.sock — then the bridge carries it — or a
separate replication process), the row that a revoked follow grant stops `log` over the bridge, the row
that an unknown ssh key is refused by sshd (sshe2e), and the CONNECTIONS_MAX / idle-deadline numbers for
remote conns (PROTOCOL-8 names an idle deadline as CLIENT's). Asked of PROTOCOL (a45ff664477fefd42).
**Meta-critique.** I recommend B partly because it is the shape I can test on one laptop (two ssh-less
pipes stand in for sshd); A's real check is sshd configuration, which no test here can run. minidregg had
a forced-command `mini socket-proxy` (CLIENT-4's rejected alternative), so B is also familiarity; the
difference I claim is that B carries the existing conn-tagged frame, not a new proxy protocol.
**PROTOCOL's answer (a45ff664477fefd42, 10-16).** B. A remote follow catches up only through
`host(log, envelope)` steps relayed by nd over host.sock (so over the bridge); the envelope (member,
follow-grant id, fromHeight, validUntil, signature) becomes layout data in Protocol/Table.lean; revocation
refuses `noFollowGrant`; an unknown ssh key is a refused connect (no frame, no protocol name);
`Protocol.Bounds.idleMsMax` will be generated for remote conns; CONNECTIONS_MAX stays 64.
**Status.** B chosen; build waits for PROTOCOL's rows and `idleMsMax` in generated.rs (sha to come).
