# decisions/client.md — BUILD-CLIENT (client/, sandbox/)

Earlier entries, frozen in `DECISIONS.md`: CLIENT-1 (Rust at all; ruled by ROOT 2026-10-16: custody +
transport only, ≤ 2,000 lines), CLIENT-2 (follow drives by steps; ruled, protocol in HOST-9), CLIENT-3
(attempts), CLIENT-4 (workspace dir, OpenSSH forwarding), CLIENT-5 (Ed25519 until KERNEL names the
scheme), CLIENT-6 (no binary until the generated table), CLIENT-7 (sandbox/ own crate, Hermes is a member;
ruled), CLIENT-8 (isolation invariant), KEY-CUSTODY (open, for Ember).

## CLIENT-9 one confinement shape, deny by default, one mechanism per platform, no fallback (2026-10-16; allow-list landed by CLIENT-2)
**Decision.** `sandbox/` exposes one function: `command(policy, program, args) -> Command`. The policy
is ALLOWS plus an invariant: `read`, `write`, `exec` (paths the child may touch; the program, which must
be absolute, is always read+exec) and `hidden` (paths that must lie outside every allowed path and the
platform floor; a policy where one reaches the other, either way, is refused as `Exposed` before
launch). macOS: `sandbox-exec` with `(deny default)`, `process-exec` of the program and `exec`,
`file-read*` of the floor + read/exec/write, `file-write*` of write, `file-read-metadata` of each
allowed path's ancestors (realpath stats them). The macOS floor was MEASURED by bisecting a deny-default
profile until `/bin/cat` and a lake-built Lean exe (host-sim, ALL PASS) ran: the `/` listing (literal;
dyld aborts with rc 134 without it — the predecessor's failed attempt), `/dev/urandom` (the Lean
runtime opens it at start), `/usr/lib`, `/System/Volumes/Preboot/Cryptexes` (the dyld shared cache).
No network, no mach/IPC, no fork, no sysctl. Linux: `bwrap --unshare-all --disable-userns --cap-drop
ALL --clearenv --dev /dev --proc /proc`, read-only binds of the floor (`/usr`, `/lib`, `/lib64`,
`/etc/ld.so.cache`, the optional ones `-try`) and of read/exec/program, `--bind` of write, nothing else
mounted. The environment is cleared on both. Any other platform, a missing mechanism, a missing or
unnameable path: refused by name, never launched. `nd-supervise` takes `--hide/--read/--write/--exec`.
A Host child gets `--write STORE --hide WORKSPACE` and nothing else (HOST-2's answer: STORE is the only
path it reads or writes). It gets NO socket: the child speaks only stdio, the supervisor holds the
sockets, so the brief's "allow the sockets" is deliberately not granted.
**Alternatives.** (a) The deny-list this replaced (`(allow default)` minus the hidden paths, `--ro-bind
/ /` + tmpfs); (b) Landlock on Linux (in-process, no bwrap); (c) minidregg's two bwrap profiles (P3);
(d) a whole-volume read allow with only writes restricted.
**Why.** The child is a parser of bytes from the network (a friend's frames); it should see the Store
and its own runtime, not the member's home (other keys, the ssh agent socket, browser profiles), which a
deny-list exposed. With deny-by-default the CLIENT-8 invariant is a CHECK on the policy plus a plant on
the profile, not a rule that might be forgotten. One argv shape for every child is law 1.
**Critique.** The floor is a hand list measured on ONE macOS version; an update that moves the dyld cache
breaks every child at launch (loudly: abort, which is the right failure, but a dead node). `/usr/lib`
and `/System/…/Cryptexes` are subtrees, wider than the dylibs one exe links. Children must be given
REAL paths (a `/var/…` argument fails: the `/var` link is not readable); nd-supervise does not rewrite
argv, so the service file must. `sandbox-exec` is deprecated by Apple. The Linux branch has only been
`cargo clippy --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`-checked, never run (no Linux box; hbox is Ember's):
merged-/usr distributions with `/lib → usr/lib` symlinks may need `--symlink` instead of a bind, and
that is unknown. The tests' python children need their framework prefix as read+exec (it re-execs
itself), which is a test fixture's need leaking into the policy surface (`exec`).
**Meta-critique.** I measured the floor with the two binaries I had and stopped when they ran; a real
`host serve` (FFI to Host/c, fsync, flock on LOCK) may need more, and I am assuming flock/fsync on an
allowed fd need no extra operation. The "no sockets" call contradicts my brief; I think the brief
assumed the child dials, and HOST-2 says it does not.
**Plants.** sandbox/tests/confine.rs: confined cat reads an allowed file (control), fails on the seed in
the hidden workspace AND on an unmentioned sibling file (the allow-list property: red under the old
deny-list), a policy reaching the workspace (read its parent, or write it) is `Exposed`. Mutations:
adding `(subpath "/")` to the read clause, or `(allow default)`, turns both confine and
client/tests/supervise.rs red (`isolation: child read the seed`).
**Status.** landed (macOS run; Linux check-only).

## CLIENT-10 the step layout read by hand until it is emitted — a twin with an expiry (2026-10-16)
**Decision.** `client/src/wire.rs` reads and writes the step layouts of proposals/client.md §2
(argv, the four steps, resume) by hand, so `nd` runs end to end now. It is deleted the day PROTOCOL /
CODEC commit the layout in Lean and `Emit/Rust.lean` emits its reader; the step TAGS already come
from `generated.rs`. Asked of PROTOCOL/CODEC: the layout as a `Codec` in Lean and its Rust reader.
**Alternatives.** Wait (no `nd`, no end-to-end plant); have follow speak a layout the generator
already covers (it covers none yet).
**Critique.** This is exactly the shape law 1 forbids and HOST-5 already named: a Rust codec of a
Lean-owned shape, with a promised expiry. If the Lean layout differs, the round-trip test still passes
against its own scripted follow (a mirror) — the integration with BUILD-HOST's follow is the real check.
**Meta-critique.** ROOT asked for running binaries before my handoff, and that deadline chose this.
**Status.** superseded (CLIENT-2, 2026-10-16). CODEC landed the layouts as Lean data with an emitted
reader at f81e093 (`generated::layout::{Command, Resume, Step}`, CODEC-8: `k` and `result` are
length-prefixed); wire.rs is deleted and `run.rs` uses the generated `Step` itself (its own `Step` enum
was a second copy of the same shape). The client still checks the encoded `command` against
`ARGV_BYTES_MAX`, because the emitted `list` bounds each item and the count, not the total
(`Bounds.argvBytesMax` is stated as the total; asked of CODEC to make the Lean codec carry it).
