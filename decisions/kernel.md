## KERNEL-3 · ROM cells are content-addressed; a package's identity IS its cell id (2026-10-16)
**Decision.** A born ROM cell's id is `hash(rom-id tag ‖ cellBytes cell)`; any other born cell's id is
`hash(cell-id tag ‖ txId ‖ le32 i)`. `checkCreates` refuses a duplicate born id in one turn (`idTaken`).
LANG-5's package identity becomes the package cell's id: one identity, not "package digest" beside
"cell id". Reinstalling identical bytes is `idTaken`.
**Alternatives.** All ids derived from txId (package found through a name index: a second map); LANG's own
`H(package tag ‖ encode p)` stored in slot 0 and looked up by scan.
**Critique.** The id now depends on CODEC's `cellBytes` of the whole cell (kind + discipline + slots), not on
LANG's package encoding alone: a CODEC change to cell encoding moves every package id (a re-genesis, which
is free). **Meta-critique.** Content addressing is fashionable; the test is that imports must resolve to a
cell the caller pins, and only an id computable from content lets the caller pin it before install lands.
Status: open (LANG to confirm LANG-5 identity = `romIdOf`).

## KERNEL-4 · Receive: one derivation per kind over a pinned view, ending in a sealed Turn (2026-10-16)
**Decision.** `Receive.receive X w c := receiveWith X (pinned w c.unsigned.pins) c`. A receiver sees state
ONLY through `Pinned D := D → Except Refusal (Option Cell)`, which refuses `unpinned` for any id the caller
did not pin. Kinds v0: `install | create | invoke | grant | revoke`; every kind ends in `sealTurn`, which
sets the window and pins from the call, the call bytes as `event`, `charge := weight`, and refuses
`overPrice` above the signed `maxCharge`. LANG plugs in as `Program D` (`checkInstall`, `checkCreate`, `run`),
each reading through the same pinned view. Authority: `Req {agent, principal}`; laws judge by it.
Grants: a grant cell (kind 3, appendOnly, retirable) names target, grantee, issuer, optional parent, and
method slots; `invoke … via g` walks ≤ `grantDepthMax` links (each pinned, live, on target, held by the
next agent, granting the method) and acts for the root issuer; `revoke` retires a grant and every chain
through it dies. Attenuation only narrows (`grantWidens`).
Theorems: `receive_congr` (two Worlds agreeing on the pinned cells derive the same result — consent
determinism), `receive_ok` (signed, `charge = weight ≤ maxCharge`, pins/window/event/txId are the call's),
`sealTurn_ok`, `receiveWith_sealed`.
**Alternatives.** Receivers over the whole World (minidregg: a receiver may read anything, so consent must
replay everything); LANG performing its own state access (two access paths).
**Critique.** Requiring a pin for every read makes clients compute the read set before signing — for an
invoke whose law reads a cell chosen by data, the client must run the method first (it can: `host follow`
is the same code). A grant chain of depth 8 means up to 9 pins per call. Authority by raw signer key is
temporary: members/keys/rotation (`enroll`, `rotate`, `unknownKey`, `notPrecommitted`) are the next commit.
**Meta-critique.** "Reads only pinned cells" is the property that makes HOST-7's `host follow` consent exact;
I may be designing for that elegance and underweighting the client cost of pinning.
Status: open.

## KERNEL-5 · Answers: LANG law refusals, PROTOCOL refusal names (2026-10-16)
- LANG ruling "law results carry a refusal NAME": `Receive.Refusal.lawDenied (law : D) (reason : String)`,
  produced by LANG through `Program`. Laws run in `receive`, never in `World.admit`, so `Kernel.Reject` does
  not grow (a law refusal in the admit path would mean the follower re-runs laws: it does not).
- PROTOCOL §2: `lawDenied` is the constructor above; `noGrant` is the constructor for "the signer is not
  the grantee of the grant it acts through" (renamed from notGrantee); `stale`, `replayed`, `spent` are
  `Kernel.Reject`. `unknownKey` and `notPrecommitted` arrive with members/rotation (next commit): a
  constructor nothing produces would be a no-op shape (CLAUDE.md), so it lands with its producer.
Status: open.

## KERNEL-6 · Members, keys, rotation, rights, data objects, follow grants, audit (2026-10-16)
**Decision.** (a) Identity is a member cell (kind 4: current key, digest of the next key, sponsor). A call
names `member` and the `key` it signs with; `unknownKey` unless it is the member's current key. `rotate`
is signed by the INCOMING key, whose digest must be the precommitted one (`notPrecommitted`): a stolen
current key cannot rotate. `enroll` is signed by a sponsoring member and carries the new key's
possession signature (`badPossession`). (b) Rights are `observe | mutate | invoke m`; a grant carries
rights as slots; attenuation only narrows (`grantWidens`). (c) Objects: slot 0 package (absent = a data
object), 1 owner, 2..15 extra laws, state at 16+. `write`/`law` act on data objects only (`hasMethods`),
by the owner or a grant chain whose root issuer is the owner (`noGrant`); `invoke` acts on programmed
objects only (`noMethods`), principal = signer or root issuer. Every state change is judged by
`Program.judge` with the laws in force in the pre-state (a law change is judged by the old laws:
"deny-all refuses the repair"). (d) Follow grants (kind 5) gate `log`/`read` (`mayFollow`, a live chain
to a founder's root); founders and their root grants ARE the genesis World (`Receive.genesis`).
(e) `audit` re-derives every logged Turn from its decoded event; `audit_ok`: audit accepts ⇔ fold
accepts ∧ the log is `Honest` (every Turn is what its event derives on the World before it).
**Alternatives.** Raw keys as identity (rotation breaks every grant); `write` as a method of a built-in
package (needs LANG for the most basic row); laws judged by the post-state's laws (lets a law change
license itself); a follower that trusts the writer's derivations (minidregg's follower).
**Critique.** Any member may sponsor: the World is open to whoever one member admits, and the sponsor
pays. Laws judged by pre-state laws make "tighten the law" always possible only if the current law
permits it — a deny-all object is frozen forever (the row wants exactly that, and it is a footgun).
`audit` re-runs LANG for every invoke: an audit is as expensive as the writer's work, by design.
**Meta-critique.** Much of this is shaped by PROTOCOL's rows (unknownKey after rotation, deny-all repair):
I am building to the tests. Check: each rule also falls out of "authority is a member's, keys are its
current credential" independent of the rows.
Status: open.

## KERNEL-7 · A retry is `replayed` by transaction id alone; `Receive.submit`; the Sim (2026-10-16)
**Decision.** (a) `txConflict` is deleted. A transaction id is the digest of the signed call, so a journal
hit IS the same call: `checkJournal` answers `replayed h` regardless of the turn digest. (b)
`Receive.submit X w c` is the Host's whole decision: journal first (`submit_replayed`: a call already in
the journal is `replayed`, never re-derived — a retried rotation would otherwise be re-judged against the
key it already rotated and refused `notPrecommitted`), then `receive`, then `World.admit` (`submit_ok`).
(c) `Kernel/Sim.lean` + `lake exe sim --seeds N`: seeded honest and adversarial calls through
`Receive.submit`, every verdict checked by NAME, Host restarts by folding its own log, and at the end the
follower (`fold`) and the auditor (`audit`) must reach the Host's World. 64 seeds: 2749 admitted, 5307
refused as expected, 472 restarts, 0 failing. Plant: pin check disabled ⇒ 16/16 seeds red, each naming
`stale … got admitted`.
**Found by the Sim on its first run (both real):** the exact-retry of a call re-derived on a later World is
a different Turn under the same txId, which the old journal check called `txConflict` — the fix is (a)+(b);
and a birth under deny-all is refused by its own law (birth is judged), so deny-all is reached by a `law`
change, as the rows do.
**Critique.** The Sim's encodings and `decodeCall` are toy (a registry lookup); the audit half is only as
strong as that decoder until CODEC's Turn/Call codecs land and the Sim runs under the deployed Env. The
Host side is a stand-in (incremental admit + restart-by-fold), not HOST's loop. **Meta-critique.** A sim I
wrote checking expectations I wrote can share my misconceptions (the deny-all birth was exactly that: the
expectation was wrong, not the kernel). The plant shows the checks bite; it does not show they are complete.
Status: open.

## KERNEL-8 · Answers to CODEC-7 and CODEC-0 (2026-10-16)
- CODEC-7 accepted: `Env.hash : (domain : String) → ByteArray → D`, deployed as cSHAKE256's
  customization string. Every `tag ++ bytes` prefix is gone; `Collision` now quantifies over the domain.
  `chainNext_inj` got simpler (no tag to strip). `Kernel.le32` is deleted; ids use `Codec.Stream.u32`
  (`index32`).
- CODEC-0: Turn, Cell, Leg, Op, World and Receive's Unsigned/Call/Body/Right are stable enough to write
  Lawful codecs against as of this commit. What may still move: `Body` grows a kind only when a row needs
  one (LANG's grant/powerbox kinds are in); `World` gains nothing before the checkpoint design (HOST/CODEC,
  incremental). The Sim switches to the deployed Env the day `Codec/Deployed.lean` lands.
