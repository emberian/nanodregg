# Lang.Journey — the first law end to end: install → create → invoke through KERNEL's receivers

`lake exe lang-journey` drives the REAL receive path (`Receive.submit` = `receive` then
`World.admit`) with `Lang.program` as the kernel's `Program`, under the Sim's toy parameters
(UInt64 digest, FNV hash, toy signatures: memory "toy parameters in the real pipeline"). The
package `Owned` keeps `{owner : bytes, total : nat}`; its method `set n` writes `total := n`; its
laws are `bounded` (`new.total ≤ 100`, else "over 100") and `ownerOnly` (the SIGNING member must be
the owner and the owner never changes). Rows:

* L0 the text form of `Owned` (`Lang.Read`, what a resident writes) reads to the same bytes.
* L1 founder A installs `Owned` (a ROM cell, id `romIdOf`) — admitted.
* L2 A creates an object owned by A, seed `{owner = A, total = 0}`, judged by both laws — admitted.
* L3 A invokes `set 50` — admitted; the object's `total` slot decodes to 50.
* L4 A invokes `set 101` — refused `lawDenied` by `bounded`, nothing written.
* L5 B invokes `set 7` through A's grant for method 0 (so the principal is A, the grant's root
  issuer) — refused `lawDenied` by `ownerOnly`, which checks the SIGNER: a law can be stricter than
  the principal.
* L6 a package whose body does not check at its interface — refused `program` at install.
* L8 (ID-1) `Tally`'s law `fresh` cases on the occasion: a birth seeded with approvals is refused,
  a zero seed admitted.
* L8d/e the invoke's method index reaches the law: `fresh` closes method `b`, `a` passes.
* L9 (ID-1) `Frozen`, an extra law on a data object, refuses its own replacement; writes pass.
* L10 the relaw carries the incoming law ids: `OnlyTo [Frozen]` refuses a replacement by `[Tally]`
  and admits one by `[Frozen]`.
* L7 the follower (`World.fold` from genesis) and the auditor reach the Host's World.
* PLANT skip-judge: the same rows against a program whose `judge` admits everything: L4 must be
  ADMITTED there (the row flips), proving the refusal in L4 came from the law, not from elsewhere.
* PLANT erase-occasion: the same rows against a program whose judge is told every act is a write
  (the judge before ID-1): L8b, L8e, L9d and L10c must be ADMITTED there, so their refusals came
  from the occasion.
* PLANT erase-payload: the occasion's payload is lost (a relaw names no laws, every invoke is
  method 0): L8e must be admitted and L10d refused, so the payload reaches the law.

/-! ### The occasion rows (ID-1): a law that knows which act it judges

`Tally` keeps `{approvals : nat, total : nat}`; its law `fresh` refuses a birth whose seed carries
approvals and admits every other act. `Frozen` is a law package over a data object whose law
refuses any replacement of the laws and admits every other act. Without the occasion both were
unwritable: `create` judges the seed as `old = new`, and `law` judges the unchanged state, so each
looked like a no-op write. -/
