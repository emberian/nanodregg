# Protocol.Proofs.Command — the verbs, the parser's bound, and consent

Consent (PROTOCOL-4, HOST-9): the only call follow ever hands the client to submit is
`X.callBytes ⟨u, sig⟩` for a `u` that `plan` produced on follow's World — and `plan` produces `u`
only when the receivers derive a Turn from it on that World AND `World.admit` accepts that Turn.
So a member is never asked to submit a call its own fold refuses.
